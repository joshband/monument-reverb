## Loopers and Audio Memory

**Loop pedals** (also called loopers) are electronic devices that capture a segment of an incoming audio signal and play it back in real time.  Musicians use them to build layered performances by overdubbing successive phrases.

### How loopers work

- When you step on the footswitch, the looper records the audio coming into its input.  Upon the next tap, it instantly plays back the recorded segment, creating a loop【397308062428236†L85-L97】.
- Modern loopers store the recorded audio as WAV data using internal memory or removable media and allow multiple minutes of recording time and nearly unlimited overdubs【397308062428236†L92-L97】.
- Additional features may include multiple loop channels, tempo‑sync, reverse or half‑speed playback, built‑in drum machines and MIDI synchronisation.

### Audio memory

In the context of delays and loopers, *audio memory* refers to the buffer used to store past audio samples.  Devices like the Chase Bliss Habit extend this idea by continuously recording everything you play and allowing you to scan back in time to recall or reconfigure the recorded material.
