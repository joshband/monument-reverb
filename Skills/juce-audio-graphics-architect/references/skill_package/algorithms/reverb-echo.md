## Reverb and Echo

**Reverberation** is the persistent decay of sound in a space after the source stops.  It arises when countless small reflections from walls, floors and other surfaces overlap and blend into a smooth tail【382356893620452†L63-L69】.  Reverberation is an essential component of natural listening environments and is used extensively in audio production to add depth and space.

**Echo**, on the other hand, is a discrete reflection of sound that arrives noticeably after the original, such as shouting into a canyon and hearing your voice return.  Echoes are perceived as separate repeats rather than a continuous wash.

### Differences

The distinction between echo and reverb lies in the density and timing of reflections.  Echo is heard as a distinct repetition or delay of a sound【382356893620452†L319-L327】, whereas reverb is a dense tail of overlapping reflections that cannot be individually distinguished【382356893620452†L319-L327】.  In production, echo (often implemented via delays) is used for rhythmic emphasis, while reverb provides spatial depth without discrete repeats【382356893620452†L349-L352】.

### Practical considerations

Knowing when to use echo or reverb is key to achieving the desired spatial effect.  Echo can clutter a mix if its repeats interfere with timing, whereas too much reverb can wash out detail【382356893620452†L349-L356】.
