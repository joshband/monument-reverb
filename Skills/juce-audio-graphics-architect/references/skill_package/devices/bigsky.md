## Strymon BigSky – Multidimensional Reverb Workstation

**BigSky** is a flagship reverb pedal and plug‑in from Strymon.  It offers a wide range of reverb algorithms and extensive control for sound designers and performers.

### Highlights

- **Twelve hand‑crafted reverb machines:** The BigSky contains twelve unique algorithms, each designed for a particular style of reverb【357543303053795†L1483-L1486】.  These include familiar types like Hall, Plate, Room and Spring as well as more exotic machines such as Bloom, Chorale, Shimmer, Swell, Magneto and Reflections.
- **High‑quality conversion and processing:** Ultra‑low noise A/D and D/A converters and a high‑performance DSP engine ensure pristine sound【357543303053795†L1483-L1491】.
- **Analog dry path:** The dry signal remains completely analog for zero latency and uncompromised tone【357543303053795†L1488-L1489】.
- **Extensive preset management:** Up to 300 presets can be stored and recalled via the encoder, footswitches or MIDI【357543303053795†L1491-L1492】.
- **Deep editing:** Each reverb machine exposes numerous parameters, assignable to two dedicated knobs for quick access【357543303053795†L1491-L1494】.
- **Stereo I/O and expression control:** BigSky operates in stereo and provides an expression pedal input capable of controlling multiple parameters simultaneously【357543303053795†L1493-L1495】.
- **Cab filter and analog boost:** A selectable cabinet filter makes it easy to go direct into a mixing console, and each preset can apply up to ±3 dB of analog boost or cut【357543303053795†L1496-L1498】.
- **Reverb trails and bypass options:** Trails can persist when bypassed, and the global bypass can be set to true bypass or buffered【357543303053795†L1498-L1502】.
- **Rugged chassis and intuitive UI:** The pedal is housed in a lightweight anodized aluminum enclosure and features a performance‑oriented interface【357543303053795†L1498-L1503】.

### Practical uses

BigSky is prized for its versatility.  It can deliver anything from subtle room ambience to huge cinematic washes and ethereal shimmer effects.  Its deep parameter set invites experimentation, while the large preset capacity makes it easy to recall favourite sounds on stage or in the studio.
