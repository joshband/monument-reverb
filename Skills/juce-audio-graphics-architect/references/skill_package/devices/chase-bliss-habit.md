## Chase Bliss Habit – Echo Collector

The **Chase Bliss Habit** is described as a “delay with a memory.”  It continuously records everything you play and offers creative ways to revisit and manipulate that material.

### Key features

- **Delay with memory:** Habit stores everything you play for up to 60 seconds and lets you recall it later.  You can revisit loops, design echo patterns and even harmonize with yourself several minutes back【756325403414970†screenshot】.
- **Interconnected machinery:** Two banks of modifiers let you shape the character of the repeats—ranging from tape‑style delay and dissolving echoes to subdivisions that shrink or expand the delay intervals【794146278916888†screenshot】.
- **Scanning the tape:** Habit behaves like a digital tape loop.  It continuously records your playing and allows you to **scan back in time** to access past moments【68525904729353†screenshot】.  You can move freely through the memory or let the pedal scan automatically.
- **Secondary echoes:** A Spread control generates secondary echoes so you can listen to two moments simultaneously, creating complex, polyrhythmic delay patterns【794146278916888†screenshot】.

### Usage ideas

Habit encourages improvisation.  You can use it to build evolving loops, create cascading echoes with unpredictable feedback and capture entire compositions inside the pedal.
