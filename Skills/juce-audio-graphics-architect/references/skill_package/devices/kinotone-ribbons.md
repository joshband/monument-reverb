## Kinotone Ribbons – Tape Effects Toolkit

**Ribbons** is a compact effects unit that emulates the idiosyncrasies of vintage tape.  The user manual describes it as a powerful toolkit for exploring “imperfect” mediums【875380392818289†screenshot】.

### Controls and interface

- **Page‑based editing:** Ribbons organises its parameters into four pages accessible via a push button.  Each page edits a different set of tape‑effect parameters, with colour‑coded icons indicating which controls are active【795300359553208†screenshot】.
- **Tape effects:** The default mode (page 1) allows manipulation of virtual tape behaviours such as wow and flutter, tape saturation and echo feedback【795300359553208†screenshot】.
- **Bypass and power:** A dedicated footswitch engages or disengages the effect, and the manual cautions against powering Ribbons via a daisy chain【875380392818289†screenshot】.

### Philosophy

Ribbons celebrates the quirks of imperfect recording technologies.  By giving users direct control over tape artefacts, it encourages creative sound design and performance techniques that embrace imperfection.
