## SOMA Laboratory Cosmos – Drifting Memory Station

**Cosmos** is a self‑contained sound processor designed to create evolving, meditative soundscapes.  Rather than producing a traditional delay or looper effect, it functions as a “drifting memory station.”

### Core concept

- **Endless recombination:** Cosmos records incoming audio and constantly recombines it using mathematically controlled time shifts.  The manual describes prime‑number‑based delay lengths, asynchronous low‑frequency oscillators and chaotic modulation that prevent the repetitions from aligning【986922461742756†screenshot】.
- **Evolving soundscapes:** Because the delay lengths are not multiples of one another, layers drift and evolve without forming a repetitive loop, producing rich, fluid textures ideal for meditative performances【986922461742756†screenshot】.

### Use cases

Cosmos is well suited for ambient music, sound therapy and any context where a performer wants to generate endlessly evolving backgrounds.  Its architecture invites the user to surrender control and listen as the memory slowly transforms the input into something new.
