## Strymon Cloudburst – Ambient Reverb

The **Cloudburst** is an ambient reverb pedal designed to produce lush, evolving reverbs with a minimal control set.  Its manual outlines a collection of features that make it suitable for both subtle ambience and expansive soundscapes.

### Features

- **Hand‑crafted reverb algorithm:** Cloudburst employs a computationally intensive reverb engine that aims for high realism and musicality【876625921092337†L771-L774】.
- **Tone and Pre‑Delay controls:** Dedicated knobs let you shape the high‑frequency content of the reverb and adjust the time before the reverb tail begins, enabling flexible tonal and spatial shaping【876625921092337†L771-L774】.
- **Adjustable modulation:** The MOD control adds a range of modulation to the reverb, from subtle movement to intense warbling【876625921092337†L774-L776】.
- **Ensemble effect:** A three‑position switch engages a harmonically rich pad generated by analysing the input signal; it adds lush orchestral layers on top of the reverb【876625921092337†L775-L788】.
- **Analog dry path:** An analog dry signal path provides zero‑latency pass‑through and avoids A/D conversion on the dry signal【876625921092337†L776-L779】.
- **Freeze and Infinite modes:** Separate modes allow the reverb tail to be held indefinitely, either freezing the current ambience or letting it build continuously【876625921092337†L786-L787】.
- **Stereo I/O and expression:** Cloudburst supports stereo input/output and includes an expression pedal input for controlling parameters, plus full MIDI support and USB‑C for firmware updates【876625921092337†L781-L800】.
- **High‑performance hardware:** The pedal uses a 520 MHz ARM processor with 32‑bit floating‑point processing and low‑noise A/D and D/A converters【876625921092337†L788-L799】.

### Use cases

Cloudburst excels at ambient textures, adding a lush tail to any instrument.  Its simple controls and Ensemble switch make it easy to dial in complex, evolving atmospheres without menu‑diving.
