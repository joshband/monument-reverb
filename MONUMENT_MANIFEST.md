# Monument Manifesto

## 1. Purpose

Monument is an abstract, architectural reverb for impossible-scale space.
It is a compositional tool for massive, slow, dense, evolving ambience.

Monument is not a room simulator.
It is not a plate, spring, or hall emulation.
It does not chase realism or familiar acoustic cues.

## 2. Behavioral Pillars

- Scale over realism
- Density over echo
- Slow tectonic motion
- Controlled instability
- Mono-safe vastness

## 3. Mental Model

Monument is a structure sound enters, not a space that reflects sound.
The input is absorbed, refracted, and redistributed through a colossal interior.

Decay should feel like weight settling, not energy fading.
Bloom should feel like a delayed expansion that grows after the source has stopped.
Density should feel continuous and fog-like, not discrete or rhythmic.

## 4. Core Controls (plain language definitions)

- Mass: how heavy and immovable the space feels.
- Time: overall duration of the structure's response.
- Density: how tightly packed the reflections become.
- Bloom: how much late energy swells after the initial response.
- Air: high-frequency openness and lift.
- Width: stereo spread and spatial reach.
- Mix: balance between dry source and Monument.

## 5. Advanced Controls

- Warp: bends the internal geometry over time.
- Drift: slow, random motion in the structure.
- Gravity: pulls energy downward or upward in tone.
- Freeze: locks the structure in a sustained state.

## 6. Non-Goals

- Realistic room or hall presets
- Shimmer, octave, or pitch-shifted tails
- Convolution-based realism
- Short ambience utilities or slapback effects
- Genre-specific presets

## 7. Sound References

- Vast, heavy, and slow-moving ambience
- Dense, nearly continuous tails without audible repeats
- Late bloom that rises after the dry signal disappears
- Subtle motion that never becomes modulation chorus
- Spacious even in mono, without phase collapse
