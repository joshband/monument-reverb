# Preset Gallery

- Init Patch: A clean, even hall with no motion, ready to be shaped.
- Stone Hall: Hard surfaces and steady air hold the sound in place, with no movement.
- High Vault: Tall ceilings lift the sound upward, bright and still.
- Cold Chamber: A cool, heavy room where the sound settles quickly and stays put.
- Night Atrium: Wide and quiet, with a soft roof of darkness that keeps everything calm.
- Monumental Void: Immense and sparse, the space feels carved out of silence.
- Stone Circles: Short, grounded rings gather in layers, with a faint sense of earlier steps lingering.
- Cathedral of Glass: Bright surfaces carry long light trails; a few remnants drift back, fragile and high.
- Zero-G Garden: Light and buoyant, the space breathes; soft afterimages barely return.
- Weathered Nave: The hall seems to absorb what passes through it, letting a softened trace rise later.
- Dust in the Columns: Fine dust hangs in the air; sounds leave a faint residue that settles slowly.
- Frozen Monument (Engage Freeze): A still, glassy hold that waits in place, with only the quietest return.
- Ruined Monument (Remembers): The space remembers what touched it, releasing darkened pieces long after the moment passes.
- What the Hall Kept: What passes through is kept and released later, quieter and weathered.
- Event Horizon: The room bends toward a heavy center, then sends back shadows of what fell in.
- Folded Atrium: A folded space where entrances and exits blur, and earlier notes reappear like mistaken doors.
- Hall of Mirrors: Reflections lose their order as the hall folds inward, returning softened images out of sequence.
- Tesseract Chamber: The room turns in on itself; distant traces drift back, slightly misplaced in time.
