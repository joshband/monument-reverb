# Preset Gallery

Monument ships with 23 curated presets exploring architectural spaces and sonic textures.

## Traditional Presets (1-17)

- **Init Patch**: A clean, even hall with no motion, ready to be shaped.
- **Stone Hall**: Hard surfaces and steady air hold the sound in place, with no movement.
- **High Vault**: Tall ceilings lift the sound upward, bright and still.
- **Cold Chamber**: A cool, heavy room where the sound settles quickly and stays put.
- **Night Atrium**: Wide and quiet, with a soft roof of darkness that keeps everything calm.
- **Monumental Void**: Immense and sparse, the space feels carved out of silence.
- **Stone Circles**: Short, grounded rings gather in layers, with a faint sense of earlier steps lingering.
- **Cathedral of Glass**: Bright surfaces carry long light trails; a few remnants drift back, fragile and high.
- **Zero-G Garden**: Light and buoyant, the space breathes; soft afterimages barely return.
- **Weathered Nave**: The hall seems to absorb what passes through it, letting a softened trace rise later.
- **Dust in the Columns**: Fine dust hangs in the air; sounds leave a faint residue that settles slowly.
- **Frozen Monument (Engage Freeze)**: A still, glassy hold that waits in place, with only the quietest return.
- **Ruined Monument (Remembers)**: The space remembers what touched it, releasing darkened pieces long after the moment passes.
- **What the Hall Kept**: What passes through is kept and released later, quieter and weathered.
- **Event Horizon**: The room bends toward a heavy center, then sends back shadows of what fell in.
- **Folded Atrium**: A folded space where entrances and exits blur, and earlier notes reappear like mistaken doors.
- **Hall of Mirrors**: Reflections lose their order as the hall folds inward, returning softened images out of sequence.
- **Tesseract Chamber**: The room turns in on itself; distant traces drift back, slightly misplaced in time.

## Evolving Spaces - "Living" Presets (18-22)

These presets use Monument's modulation matrix to create organic, evolving spaces that respond to audio or move autonomously.

- **Breathing Stone** (18): The space expands and contracts with your audio. AudioFollower modulates Bloom, creating dynamic swells that breathe with the input signal.

- **Drifting Cathedral** (19): A vast hall that slowly wanders through space. BrownianMotion modulates Drift and Gravity, creating gentle spatial motion that never repeats.

- **Chaos Hall** (20): Geometry warps unpredictably. ChaosAttractor (X,Y axes) modulates Warp and Density, creating organic mutations in the reverb structure.

- **Living Pillars** (21): Early reflections morph with the music. EnvelopeTracker modulates PillarShape while AudioFollower controls Width, making the space respond musically.

- **Event Horizon Evolved** (22): A gravitational field that wobbles subtly. ChaosAttractor (Z axis) modulates Mass while BrownianMotion affects Drift, creating a slowly evolving gravitational pull.

**Note**: "Living" presets demonstrate modulation matrix capabilities. All modulation connections are hidden from the UI, encouraging discovery through listening.
