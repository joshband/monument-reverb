## 🏛️ Foundational Spaces (Presets 1-18)

Classic architectural reverbs without modulation. Perfect starting points for sound design.

- **Init Patch**: A clean, even hall with no motion, ready to be shaped.
- **Stone Hall**: Hard surfaces and steady air hold the sound in place, with no movement.
- **High Vault**: Tall ceilings lift the sound upward, bright and still.
- **Cold Chamber**: A cool, heavy room where the sound settles quickly and stays put.
- **Night Atrium**: Wide and quiet, with a soft roof of darkness that keeps everything calm.
- **Monumental Void**: Immense and sparse, the space feels carved out of silence.
- **Stone Circles**: Short, grounded rings gather in layers, with a faint sense of earlier steps lingering.
- **Cathedral of Glass**: Bright surfaces carry long light trails; a few remnants drift back, fragile and high.
- **Zero-G Garden**: Light and buoyant, the space breathes; soft afterimages barely return.
- **Weathered Nave**: The hall seems to absorb what passes through it, letting a softened trace rise later.
- **Dust in the Columns**: Fine dust hangs in the air; sounds leave a faint residue that settles slowly.
- **Frozen Monument (Engage Freeze)**: A still, glassy hold that waits in place, with only the quietest return.
- **Ruined Monument (Remembers)**: The space remembers what touched it, releasing darkened pieces long after the moment passes.
- **What the Hall Kept**: What passes through is kept and released later, quieter and weathered.
- **Event Horizon**: The room bends toward a heavy center, then sends back shadows of what fell in.
- **Folded Atrium**: A folded space where entrances and exits blur, and earlier notes reappear like mistaken doors.
- **Hall of Mirrors**: Reflections lose their order as the hall folds inward, returning softened images out of sequence.
- **Tesseract Chamber**: The room turns in on itself; distant traces drift back, slightly misplaced in time.

## 🌊 Living Spaces (Presets 19-32)

Dynamic reverbs with modulation routing. Parameters evolve in response to input or internal modulators.

### Phase 3 Living Presets (19-23)

- **Breathing Stone** (19): The space expands and contracts with your audio. `AudioFollower → Bloom` creates dynamic swells that breathe with the input signal.

- **Drifting Cathedral** (20): A vast hall that slowly wanders through space. `BrownianMotion → Drift + Gravity` creates gentle spatial motion that never repeats.

- **Chaos Hall** (21): Geometry warps unpredictably. `ChaosAttractor.X/Y → Warp + Density` creates organic mutations in the reverb structure.

- **Living Pillars** (22): Early reflections morph with the music. `EnvelopeTracker → PillarShape` and `AudioFollower → Width` make the space respond musically.

- **Event Horizon Evolved** (23): A gravitational field that wobbles subtly. `ChaosAttractor.Z → Mass` and `BrownianMotion → Drift` create slowly evolving gravitational pull.

### Phase 6 Living Presets - Task 3 (29-37)

- **Pulsing Cathedral** (29): Reverb size swells with loud passages. `AudioFollower → Bloom (depth: 0.6)` creates dynamic spatial depth.

- **Dynamic Shimmer** (30): High-frequency air increases with input level. `AudioFollower → Air (depth: 0.5)` brightens with intensity.

- **Quantum Shimmer** (31): Physics violations ebb and flow unpredictably. `ChaosAttractor.X → ImpossibilityDegree (depth: 0.4)` bends reality with chaotic motion.

- **Morphing Cathedral** (32): Tube complexity shifts chaotically. `ChaosAttractor.Y → TubeCount (depth: 0.3)` and `BrownianMotion → Drift (depth: 0.4)` create evolving metallic spaces.

- **Fractal Space** (33): Topology morphs through chaotic attractor states. `ChaosAttractor.Z → Warp (depth: 0.5)` folds space in strange ways.

- **Elastic Drift** (34): Walls breathe with random walk motion. `BrownianMotion → Elasticity (depth: 0.6)` and `BrownianMotion → RecoveryTime (depth: 0.4)` create organic deformation.

- **Spectral Wander** (35): Tube brightness drifts organically. `BrownianMotion → MetallicResonance (depth: 0.5)` wanders through timbral space.

- **Impossible Hall** (36): Energy gain triggered by input. `AudioFollower → ParadoxGain (depth: 0.3)` creates rhythmic impossibility.

- **Breathing Chaos** (37): Elastic walls deform intermittently. `ChaosAttractor.X → Elasticity (depth: 0.5)` creates unpredictable breathing.

## ⚛️ Physical Modeling Spaces (Presets 24-28)

Presets featuring TubeRayTracer, ElasticHallway, and AlienAmplification modules.

- **Metallic Corridor** (24): Sound travels through resonant metal tubes. Strong metallic resonance with complex tube network topology.

- **Elastic Cathedral** (25): Walls pulse and breathe with the music. High elasticity with slow viscous recovery creates breathing walls.

- **Impossible Chamber** (26): Physics breaks down completely. High chaos and non-Euclidean topology create reality-bending acoustics.

- **Breathing Tubes** (27): Organic metal pipes expand and contract like lungs. `AudioFollower → RadiusVariation` and `BrownianMotion → Elasticity` create living tube networks.

- **Quantum Hall** (28): Non-Euclidean space where tubes fold through higher dimensions. `ChaosAttractor.X → CouplingStrength` and `ChaosAttractor.Y → ImpossibilityDegree` create quantum acoustics.
