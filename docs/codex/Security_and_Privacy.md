# Security and Privacy

## Secrets
- Do not paste secrets into prompts.
- Use your org-approved secret management workflow.
- Keep API keys and tokens out of the repo.

## Data handling
- Treat prompts and outputs as internal artifacts.
- Follow your org policy for sharing logs or transcripts.

## Command safety
- Review any command Codex asks to run.
- Avoid approving destructive commands unless you intend them.
- Prefer working inside the repo workspace.

## External resources
- Download external assets only from trusted sources.
- Document external dependencies in the repo.
